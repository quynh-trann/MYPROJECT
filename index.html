        <h2> About me </h2>
        <p> I’m currently a sophomore studying Computer Science at George Mason University.
             I have a deep passion for both art and programming, and I constantly strive to merge these two fields in all aspects of my life.</p>

       
     
        <h2> My skill</h2>
        
            <h3>Graphic Design</h3>

            
            <p style="text-align: left;"> I have a deep passion for art and design. During my middle and high school years, I often participated in decoration and design events. 
                This provided me with a solid foundation for web design.
                This passion fuels my creativity and allows me to approach projects with a unique perspective. 
                By combining my artistic vision with technical skills, I am able to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. My passion for design drives me to continually improve and innovate, ensuring that my work stands out and effectively meets the needs of my users.</p>
          

            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">In addition to studying programming concepts through my university courses, I have taken the initiative to teach myself several essential programming languages and technologies, including Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Beyond coding, I have developed a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms, which form the backbone of efficient software development.
                This combination of formal education and self-directed learning has equipped me with the skills and adaptability needed to tackle complex programming challenges effectively.</p>
